# vcypher
A script that encrypts and decrypts strings using poly-alphabetic substitution, written in Python!

#### OVERVIEW
This script encrypts a given string of text using interwoven [ceaser cyphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). Called a [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher), it uses a simple method called [poly-alphabetic substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher) but includes the use of a key to generate the offset index needed to encrypt each individual letter of a string.

| input | index | key | key index | lookup | output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
A | 1 | K | 11 | 12 | L |
B | 2 | E | 5  | 7  | G |
C | 3 | Y | 25 | 2  | B |
D | 4 | K | 11 | 15 | O |
E | 5 | E | 5  | 10 | J |
F | 6 | Y | 25 | 5  | E |

In the above table the alphabet has an uncomplicated index that starts at 1 and ends at 26. The key works in very much the same way and as we can see repeats to cover the total length of the string, in our case: A to F. Our lookup for the encrypted string is generated by adding this original index number to the key index and looking up the resulting characters, and of course, taking care to wrap any overflow above 26!

#### EXAMPLE

##### String: `"THE MAN IN THE HIGH KEEP IS A WIZZARD"`
##### Key: `sugarcubes`
##### Output: `mclnsqdpyaxcphznzgublvdjrcvti`
